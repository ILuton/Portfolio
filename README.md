# Creation Of My First Portfolio

## Description

- This is my first round of creating my Professional Portfolio.
- I'm sure much of it will change later but it was fun getting to practice using my html and css knowledge that I have aquired so far to create this.
- I wanted to create this in a style that I think I will utlize most in the future
- I still need to add a url for my Linkedin account once I create one, and I also want to embed a pdf viewer and have my resume able to view and download from the resume tab in the future.
- The hardest part of this project for me was trying to make the website as mobile friendly as possible. It is still not perfect, but hopefully down the line as i pick up more knowledge and skills I can put the finishing touch on things.
