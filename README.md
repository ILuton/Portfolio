# Creation Of My First Portfolio

## Description

- This is my Professional Portfolio.
- Many of these projects demonstrates knowledge that I have aquired so far in html, css, and javascript. 
- I wanted to create this in a style that I think I will utlize most in the future
- I still need to add a url for my Linkedin account once I create one, and I also want to embed a pdf viewer and have my resume able to view and download from the resume tab in the future.
- I am sure this will continue to grow and develop as i learn and develop my programming skills.
